abstract = {Most of the unknown words in texts which degrade the performance of natural language processing systems are proper nouns. On the other hand, proper nouns are recognized as a crucial source of information for identifying a topic in a text, extracting contents from a text, or detecting relevant documents in information retrieval (Rau, 1991).},

abstract="The presented work is a part of the Prolex project, whose aim is the design and implementation of a multi-lingual dictionary of proper names and their relationships. It focuses on the design of a standard XML representation for this kind of information. We first present the main lines of the conceptual model for proper names (a classical Entities / Relationships model), then we report on our experiment in designing an XML schema from this conceptual model. We describe the current resulting schema and discuss its main features.",
